# Ollama Research by David Wang

This repo was by David Wang to research how to run Ollama on Ubuntu 22.04

Ollama is a software that allows users to easily download LLMs and run them locally.

You may run Ollama with Ubuntu's terminal.
Please refer to the command_line_ollama_guide.txt in this repo for instructions.

You may also run Ollama with an interface called Open WebUI
Please refer to the docker_open_webui_ollama_guide.txt in this repo for instructions.

Do note that LLMs require heavy computation power, preferrably with GPUs and TPUs.
If you only have access to CPUs, it is suggested to run smaller models.
